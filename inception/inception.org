So why would a person want our expert to join them on a mission?

- perform inception - convince someone of something
- espionage - they need to seduce someone and gain their secrets, a regular escort is insufficient because they need her to actually bond with the person
- therapy of some sort - this would make it more a drama and less a thriller
- hypnosis, remembering
- coaching, helping someone overcome their own sexual issues

* Assumptions:
- they need her to do something
  - she is actually the target, halfway through we find out that it is her dream
- There is a single target, just one person that needs to be inception'd
- The team is breaking into someone's mind who doesn't know it
- 
  



What about personal stakes of some sort

What can you do other than reshape someone's mind? What other kinds of stakes are there?
