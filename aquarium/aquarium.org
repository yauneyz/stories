- they are literally the last people there. Chloe asks Zac to stay with her until she locks up.

  If we are going to have a lot of emotion, they have to have seen each other before
  - or do they?
    - well if we are going to say that they don't, then we will have to either:
      - go 0 to 100 real quick
      - endure a bunch of awkward firting and "get to know you"

Why are they flirting? What is their backstory up until now?

We need a list of scenes that they've already had to give them motivation.
Ideally these scenes build a bunch of tension up somehow.

Do you have to have a meet-cute? Maybe not, but there has to be an inciting incident of some form or another.
If the story is about them as a couple, then there needs to be an inciting incident.
If the story is just about them in general, then their romance is a consequence of them working together on the same goals



What do I even want to see happen in this scene?
- If they're going to kiss or go further, there has to be some turn of the subject towards something sexy
  - how does the subject of romanc/sex come up?
- If they don't have a lot of build-up, then the tension needs to come from the environtment
