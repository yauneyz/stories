My drive and desire is perhaps not typical. Maybe some men are content with just regular intercourse, and that meets their needs. Not necessariy the case for me. Expressed female desire is my dominant love language, with the next best being a distant second. However, I don't think we can just ignore that.

Learning to just "deal with it" results in the marriage being something I try to avoid, as it is a trigger that makes me feel bad. I can do this by either just emotionally checking out or (more commonly) immersing myself in something else. I don't think there is a world where I can be totally engaged and happy in the marriage and at the same time

Vacation is bad because it is what happens when you combine spending lots of time together with an asexual relationship. At home I can deal with asexuality by hiding and distracting myself

By myself I can work on being better at tolerating our marriage, but it won't make me excited about it or feel in love
The work that she can do is making me feel more into and excited about our marriage

The ways to solve the problem:
- I learn to make do with what sexuality we do have. This includes:
- need less sexuality to feel happy
- learn to feel love in other ways instead
- learn how to deal with not feeling good about our marriage.

1: So far I have made the most progress on #1 and #3. I try to regularly be sexual by myself to diminish my drive
3: I also throw myself into other things
3: I also try to remind myself that God must have some purpose for me being in this marriage

The answer for someone who is chronically starved of affection is not to tell them to learn how to get by on less affection

Knobs she can turn:
- overwhelming me with sexual affection from her part. This sounds so good to me that it hurts that it is just out of the realm of possibility on her part. The is the single bigget thing that she could do to help our marraige
- basically the same thing as the first, but specifically during sex. When she is finally aroused, shift from the recipient to the aggressor. I recognize that when we are not already in the middle of sex she has trouble feeling sexual things, but that just means we need to make it count when she is actually turned on.
- the main theme is her taking pleasure in turning me on, even if those things don't' turn her on.

Letting me do things to her is not a sufficiently fulfilling expression of desire, nor is eventually aquiescing to my continued requests.
- she has gotten significantly good at "being done" sometimes, but the next step for her is to get good at the "doing"
- while letting me do her properly is a lot more fulfilling than going through the motions, I need her to take the "doing" role sometimes
- this especially is true on vacation, where we don't have space for me to build her full arousal and do her properly. Things that turn me on are much more lightweight and can be fit in other ways
- once again, if I have to ask for and push for these lightweight things, it negates much of the effects that they would otherwise have

The biggest turn-off currently is that I am responsible for looking out for my own sexual interests.

Proposal: "And They Were Not Ashamed"

Are we really ready to be parents and do all those things when we can't even handle being a normal married couple people?

What hurts is not the lack of sex but the lack of sexuality
Orgasm isn't what makes me feel loved, sexual interaction is
- I would rather have a day of teasing and playing when we get a free moment than a handjob out of obligation in the morning/eveningj

There is a world of difference between a handjob lovingly offered and given and one that has to be negotiated for
- the sentiment is everything. The interaction is what does it for me, not so much the


No matter how many times I suggest that if she wanted to she could rock my world, she chooses not to . This is really hard to deal with
The Options:
- she knows how I feel and doesn't care
-*-*-I dont want to have bad timing or interrupt what you are doing so to me a sane person asks would you like something right now and then you interpret that as needing to ask for it instead of giving a thumbs up that I am not interrupting.
-- believes that it is my probelm to figure it out. My job is to learn how to feel loved the way that she is capable of showing love. She isn't capable of showing love in the way that I need.
-- Whenever I hold my ground on the idea that what we are doing isn't working, she uses the nuclear option and says we should get a divorce.
- she knows how I feel and doesn't feel capable of doing anything
-- the stress causes her to shift blame onto me instead of showing some kind of compassion
