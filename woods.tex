Inciting Incidents
- Making bad decisions in pursuit of a romantic interest
- An invention leads to a new way of seeing the world
- A high stakes research trip into a risky, isolated environment because there is a potentially big payoff




Idea:
Inception on an AI - there is an AI that has made VR environtments


How do we make this high stakes resaerch trip better?
Assumptions:
They are academics - they could be a startup, or a government trip, or something else
The trip is out into the wild - it could be a research trip into cyberspace. They've developed a new way of going "into" cyberspace and so they are essentially "cybernauts"
They know what they're lookng for - even better if they're going into the a completely unknown and dangerous situation. They wouldn't do it if the stakes weren't so high.
The main perspective is from the operators going in - what if they main character is a researcher/administrator/commander who doesn't actually get to go in there? He just has to operate from what he can observer
- this brings in a chance for a "Hiddem Markov Model" kind of idea


Cliches and how to get around them:
They sent in a previous team and it got lost
