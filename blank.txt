The core design problems at the heart of Thinky:

- windowing/tabs/etc
- linking ideas together in a DRY manner
- combining the previous two to handle the fractal nature of ideation


What about other businesses? What else would I build if I had to build something?

The ideal customers are internet users.

What are the main hopes and dreams of these people?

Personal Development
- make them better in some way, ideally something that brings them status or makes them feel better about themselves

So a good way to find startup ideas is to take the most popular self-help books and turn them into products
Fixing people's insecurities is one of the best "painkiller" sources out there

What are people's biggest sources of insecurity?
- looks
- money
- status (Effectively "social ability")
- intelligence
- sexual prowess
- success/efficacy (the ability to accomplish cool things)

If an app can claim to resolve any of these things in a meaningful way, you have a consumer hit on your hands

Let's brainstrorm something for each of these:

Looks: - a course/checklist/etc that gives you everything you need for a complete makeover. Advertised as "This course will serve the role of Ryan Gosling in Crazy, Stupid, Love." Properly marketed this would definitely just absolutely fly off the shelves. Work w/ Derek Guy and you have an easy million for sure.

How could you augment something like this with software?
- a very well designed link aggregator for getting the best "fashion." An app for managing your wardrobe, building a perfect capsule wardrobe
It would serve 2 functions; managing your inventory, as well as providing awesome community-vetted links and buying guides to fill in the holes in your wardrobe
- it would also help you craft your inventory skeleton
- there would have to be a large website, lots of videos, etc
- it would be a fascinating hybrid of a content-driven business model, a link aggregator, and a consumer app. Monetized 100% by affiliate links

**Extension**
An app for tracking all your possessions. A personal "inventory" app.
- If you are going to live a clutter-free life or embrace minimalism, this would be a terrific app

Status:

Status is largely projected. On Survivor it matters little what your actual outside status is, its all about projecting status
- This would combine trememndously with the "looks" part of the stack

Money: Again, a course



Is there a B2B equivalent to these things?


Professional Success
- make them better at their job, or make it require less effort

What would my theoretical flashcard service look like?
